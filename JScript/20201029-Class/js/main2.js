// =============== DOM - Document Object Model

//Document: HTML Page or Web Page

//Object: Every HTML element in the document is an object, such as <head> <body> <ul> <p> ...

//Model: How object are related to each other -- Tree

//Node: Everything that we can change in the document -- element, text, attributes ... 

//Three main things we can do with DOM:
//      1 - Change
//      2 - Add
//      3 - Delete
