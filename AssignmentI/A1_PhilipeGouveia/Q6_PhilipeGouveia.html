            Eat fruits every day to get your natural sugars. One particular
            fruit which is really great is apple. They say that "an apple a day keeps the doctor away" and 
            they're not kidding!

            Don't forget your vegetables either. Eating vegetables every day is very good for your body. 
            Leafy green vegetables like lettuce are particularly good for you. Generally, you should have
            a balanced diet of vegetables, fruits and so on.
